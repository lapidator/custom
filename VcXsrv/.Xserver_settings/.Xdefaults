! apparently ! is the comment operator in .Xresources and .Xdefaults
! syntax starting with just * applies to all Xlib applications (xclock, xfontsel, etc)
! i.e. this is a good way to go for a unified color scheme
! using .Xresources does NOT work in my case; the cmd xrdb is not even found by the system, probably as xrdb resides as xrdb.exe in my Windows VcXsrv installation
! using .Xdefaults DOES work
! for more information on Xresources and Xdefaults see: https://superuser.com/a/243916
