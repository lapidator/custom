This should apply AT LEAST to the following setup:
- WSL(2) under Win10
- VcXsrv under Win10
- i3wm under WSL(2)
- urxvt as i3-sensible-terminal (default)

When starting a VcXsrv session, then starting i3wm and then firing up a
terminal emulator for the shell of the WSL installation (bash, zsh,
whatever), it is likely to open the urxvt terminal emulator.
The defaults are white background, black foreground (standard text) and
in order to change this to a black background and a white foreground, I
found only one option working:
Create a '.Xdefaults'-file in home directory of the WSL installation
containing the following section:

! this is a comment in files like .Xresources and .Xdefaults;
! lines starting with '*' apply to all Xlib applications, 
! e.g. xclock, xfontsel, etc.
URxvt*foreground: rgb:ff/ff/ff
URxvt*background: rgb:00/00/00

I also tried creating a '.Xresources'-file, but this did not work. My
notes suggest that this required the command 'xrdb', which is however
not part of my WSL installation, but only of my Windows-installation of
VcXsrv (i.e. in its installation directory there is 'xrdb.exe').
I cannot remember whether I tried the '.Xresources'-file in the WSL
home directory AND the Windows installation directory of VcXsrv or only
one of those.
