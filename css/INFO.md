====
Mostly tested on Waterfox (a Firefox derivative).

To use scripts on websites install a respecitive addon, such as
'Stylus'. The previously famous extension Stylish fell into criticism
at some point due to data protection conflicts.

The permissions of addons were restricted with a past Firefox update,
such that addons cannot alter the browser window itself. For more
information on how to do that, see the directory 'userChrome' and
information from therein.
